* [LET and LET*](let-and-let*)

## LET and LET*
```LET``` is __parallel__ binding means that the binding come to life at the
same time and do not see each other and do not shadown each other. 

```LET*``` induces restrictions on the compiler and suggests to the user that
there's a reason that __sequential__ bindings are needed.
